Updates:

3/05/2023 - Rapido Core adjusted mounting point hole size and length to correct size and length. Thank you Lzypotato

3/05/2023 - Rapido Core added cable tie point (all cores will be updated to include this as soon as i can be bothered)

3/05/2023 - Fan brace fan mounting points have been made 0.5mm thicker (might not make a difference but i need to play around with this more as it gets tight with the extruder mounting bracket)
